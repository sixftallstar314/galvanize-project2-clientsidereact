SDI Project 2 - Client-Side Project
By completing this project, you will demonstrate that you are able to:

Build a dynamic and interactive single page application (SPA) using functional react
Layout and stylize a well designed SPA
Utilize an API to dynamically present data reflected through dynamic routing
Write robust unit and integration tests
Project Instructions
Similar to the first project you worked on, this project will give you an opportunity to plan for and create an application from the ground up. You should implement wireframing technology and set up your own user stories to help guide your development process. Follow the guidelines below to achieve your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Should utilize functional Hooks-based React Components.
Should implement standard hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext.
Should recognize situations and implement custom hooks where they can provide dynamic reusable hooks for multiple components to utilize.
Should implement at least 3 separate routes using React Router.
Should handle wildcard/dynamic routes client-side.
Should gracefully handle page refreshes on non-root routes.
Should implement testing on all top-level components.
Unit testing should be implemented for any functionality deemed critical to a component.
UI testing with should be implemented to ensure that the application as a whole behaves functionally as intended as well as behaving as expected for a potential user.
Should effectively implement styling
Feel free to use any styling libraries and/or philosophies that seems appropriate to your app, as long as your group stays consistent and you are able to achieve an effective implementation and appealing, visually cohesive final product.
You may utilize a library like styled-components or material-ui. If you'd like to make use of a different library or approach than those covered in the curriculum thus far, keep in mind that troubleshooting from instructors may be more limited depending on your choice.
No hard styling guides or requirements will be assessed, just ensure that the styling for each component matches well with the rest of the application.
Should implement live data from a third party API or utilize dummy data that you create.
Take a look at the Curated APIs List from Project 1. If none of the choices fit into the application you had in mind, feel free to create your own dummy data and use it as a replacement to data from an API. Just be careful not to fall down the rabbit hole of spending too much time crafting your dummy data.
When you are ready to start your project, fork the following repo and create the files you need to make your application work. Make sure to commit to Git often with meaningful commit messages!
